                            in the 2019 Superclásico de las Américas <br>
                            Argentina won
                            1-0 off Messi's goal. Time: 8 P.M. EST Argentina and Brazil
                            last met on Nov. 15,2021 Brazil is the most recent of the two
                            teamsto hoist the Cup, having done so in 2019 with a 3-1
                        <p>
                            If you knew the way that he (Messi) played in the Copa America you'd love him even more. You
                            can never do without a player like him, even when he is not fully fit like in this game and
                            the previous one. In the end he did not throw in the towel and he succeeded.WE are talking
                            about the best footballer of all time and everyone knew how important it was for him to win
                            a title with the national team
                            Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni revealing Lionel Messi played in the Copa America win over
                            Brazil with an injury
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Argentina won their first major title in 28 years when an Angel Di Maria goal gave them a
                            1-0 win over Brazil and a record-equalling 15th Copa America. This is Messi's first Copa
                            title and
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            Full-time: Argentina 1-0 Brazil
                            There’s the whistle and Argentina’s 28-year title drought is over! The Albiceleste have won
                            1-0 over Brazil to capture their 15th Copa América title, moving level with Uruguay for the
                            most ever! Messi is on his knees and his Argentina team-mates have surrounded him by the
                            touchline as a chorus of boos cascade down from the Maracanã stands!

                            On the other side of the pitch, a tearful Neymar is consoled by his team-mates.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Argentina won their first trophy since 1993 on Saturday, and Lionel Messi finally earned
                            silverware with his national team as they beat Brazil 1-0 at the Maracana in the 2021 Copa
                            America final. Angel Di Maria's first-half goal was enough as Lionel Scaloni's team ran
                            through the tournament with impressive results with Messi led the way, validating his
                            international career with a long-awaited trophy. Brazil, who struggled with consistency in
                            front of goal for much of the tournament, had a nightmare in attack in a match that just
                            never went their way.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The winning goal came in the 22nd minute from Di Maria, who got free down the right after an
                            error from Brazil right back Renan Lodi. A fine ball from Rodrigo de Paul really should have
                            been settled by the defender, but he took a poor angle on it, and it fell right to Di Maria,
                            who beat Ederson with a ridiculous chip. Take a look:
